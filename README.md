# Weather-Web-Application
A weather web application I built to learn more about the Openweathermap API
Building this application enabled me to resharpen my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while learning a new API!
FYI To build with this API if you are looking to do so a free account must be made first and may take a few hours to activate your APIkey.
